              I am a motivated and adaptable learner always seeking to upskill.
              As a Computer Science student under the School of Computing, I
              have had hands-on experience working with technologies like
              Python, Java and C++.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am always eager to expand my knowledge and embrace new
              challenges. Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively engage in
              self-directed learning to explore new technologies.
              <br />
              <br />
              Outside the rat race, I enjoy coding my own fun projects, watching
              football, find some silver coins & appreciate the smaller things in life.
              Honestly, I just try my best to live a fulfilling life and live
              with no regretsâ€” don&apos;t we all?
