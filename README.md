## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, experiences, and projects as a software developer. Built using ***React.js, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS*** as the tech stack, this website emphasises both functionality and user experience. This project is inspired by github user kushald.

## Features
The main code used can be found in the `src` folder.
- `App.jsx` contains the main frame of the website. Any additional sections in the `components` folder has to be included in the `App.jsx` file, else errors will occur.
- The `assets` folder contains the images and files used within the website (namely pictures displayed and resume).
- The `components` folder contains the different segments used within the website.
    - `Navbar.jsx` contains code for the topmost bar (logo + linkedin + github).
